          <h2>Chemstat</h2>
          <p> Show your technical and analytical prowess Faced with a problem statement and a real-life scenario participants would have to storm their minds to come up with a seemingly feasible solution, which, mind you, should sound just as innovative and effective. A 48-hour duration would be allotted to execute and compile their ideas into a PowerPoint presentation and submit the same, the quality of which would serve as their gateway to the final round. The ones who'll make it would have to present their plan in front of the judges and face the questionnaire.</p>
